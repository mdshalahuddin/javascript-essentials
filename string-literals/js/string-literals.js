let poem = `Bishop’s much loved and much discussed ode to loss, 

which Claudia Roth Pierpont called “a triumph of control, understatement, wit. 

Even of self-mockery, in the poetically pushed rhyme word “vaster,” 

and the ladylike, pinkies-up “shan’t.” An exceedingly rare mention of her mother—as a woman 

who once owned a watch. A continent standing in for losses larger than itself.”`
